1. The data in a digital image is a set of RGB values for each pixel. If it is "altered" those RGB values change.

2. A photo taken with light-sensitive film is actually a picture, whereas a picture on a digital camera is just a set of values that the computer changes into a picture.

3. 
	A.  It changes the value of each pixel so slightly, that humans cannot see a differece in the picture, but the numbers can represent a message.
	B. Six bits are a set of 6 1's or 0's, and each 1 or 0 means a power of 2. So, 2^0 + 2^1 + 2^2 + 2^3 + 2^4 +2^5 = 63.
	C. It would change the RGB value of the pixels resulting in a change in the color of the image.

4. The algorithm looks for  many pixels of the same value that are touching, and outputs how many of these objects are in an image.
